# FOLLOW ALONG

1. Creating Lexer Class - A Lexer iterates a given string and splits it up into tokens
    going over each give string and break it up into tokens
    Token has a type and value

    run() function is used kick-off the programm 

    __init__() function is used to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created. __init__ function is always executed when
    the class is called

    advance() function. This function is used to iterate through a given string

    make_tokens() This function is where all the Tokens are defined

    make_num() This function can identify a integer or float. This is done weather or not a '.' is found in the string

2. Position Class
    advance() unction. This function is used to iterate through a given string

3. Error Class
    This class handles all of the errors. Two types of errors as string and Illegal char

4. Parser - Syntax tree

5. Token Class
    __init__() function This is only used to initiate type_ and value these are going to be used later in this class and function



## Add new Operator - A HOW TO GUIDE

1.  Update # Syntax 
2.  crate a new Token. and add to make_tokens
2a. create new function in Parser that returns return self.bin_op(self.atom, (TOKEN, ), self.factor)
3.  Update Number Class - create new method that executes the new operator
3a. Update the Interpreter/visit_BinOpNode and add the binary operation


## Adding Variables

1. Update the Tokens (Identifier, Keyword, EQ)
2. Updating the Lexer and add the TOKEN
3.
